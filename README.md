# FTZN: 2D Football Online ⚽

## Introduction 🥅
FTZN is an acronym for 'futzin', a Brazilian expression that means football. We are a button football game, inspired by Haxball and Mamoball. Development began unpretentiously and reached impressive numbers, becoming one of the darlings of the communities of previous games. 1101 Productions started the project through [Lucas de Morais](https://github.com/mendebian) until receiving reinforcement from [Vanelton Gamedev](https://github.com/vanelton) and thus forming the team in definitive.

## About the game 📌

### Description 📝
In a more extensive explanation: FTZN is a soccer game where teams are formed from 1v1 to 4v4 in regular matches.

It is a game where there are no throw-ins, corners or any other common rules in soccer. The goal is to make it something simple and this can even be seen in the players' bodies, since they are spheres instead of complex 3D models.
